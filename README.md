# Lectern - Audiobook Preparation Tool

A Qt/QML-based desktop application for preparing audiobooks for Audiobookshelf servers. Lectern automates the conversion of MP3 directories into properly tagged M4B files with direct upload to your Audiobookshelf server.

## Features

✅ **Drag-and-Drop Interface** - Simply drag your audiobook folder into the app \
✅ **Automatic Metadata Fetching** - Queries Audnexus API for book information \
✅ **Editable Metadata** - Review and modify title, author, series, and narrator \
🔄 **Chapter Generation** - Automatic chapter creation from MP3 files (coming soon) \
✅ **M4B Conversion** - High-quality AAC encoding with FFmpeg \
✅ **Metadata Tagging** - Embeds metadata during FFmpeg conversion \
✅ **Direct Upload** - Uploads to Audiobookshelf and triggers library scan \
✅ **Real-Time Logging** - See exactly what's happening during processing \
✅ **Progress Tracking** - Visual feedback throughout the conversion pipeline

## System Requirements

### Qt6 Development Libraries

Before building, you need to install Qt6 and related development libraries:

#### Fedora/RHEL (System Package Manager)
```bash
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qtquickcontrols2-devel ffmpeg
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-quickcontrols2-dev ffmpeg
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-declarative qt6-quickcontrols2 ffmpeg
```

#### Homebrew (Alternative)
```bash
brew install qt@6 ffmpeg
```
**Note**: Homebrew Qt may require `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variables.

### Additional Tools

- **ffmpeg** - For audio processing and M4B creation
- **m4b-tool** (optional) - Enhanced M4B processing capabilities

## Building

Once the system dependencies are installed:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The build system automatically detects Qt6 libraries from your system package manager.

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**That's it!** No complex environment variables or wrapper scripts needed when using system Qt6.

### Installing System-wide

After testing, you can install for system-wide access:

```bash
sudo cp target/release/lectern /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp lectern.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure Settings** - Set up your Audiobookshelf server URL, API token, and library ID
2. **Drag Folder** - Drop a folder containing MP3 files into the app
3. **Review Metadata** - The app fetches metadata from Audible and displays it for review
4. **Edit if Needed** - Modify any metadata fields (title, author, series, narrator)
5. **Convert & Upload** - Click the button and watch the magic happen:
   - Analyzes all MP3 files and extracts durations
   - Generates chapter markers based on filenames
   - Converts to M4B with FFmpeg
   - Embeds metadata and cover art
   - Uploads to your Audiobookshelf server
   - Triggers automatic library scan

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **GUI**: Qt/QML with qmetaobject bindings
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest
- **Audio Tagging**: FFmpeg metadata embedding
- **Audio Processing**: ffmpeg (external)

## Configuration

### Audiobookshelf Setup

1. Open your Audiobookshelf web interface
2. Go to **Settings** → **Users** → Your User
3. Generate an **API Token** and copy it
4. Go to **Settings** → **Libraries** and copy your **Library ID** from the URL or library settings

### In Lectern

1. Click the **⚙ Settings** button in the header
2. Enter:
   - **Server URL**: `https://your-abs-server.com`
   - **API Token**: Your generated token
   - **Library ID**: Your library UUID
3. Click **Save**

## Usage Tips

- **File Naming**: MP3 files should be named in the order you want them (e.g., `01-chapter1.mp3`, `02-chapter2.mp3`)
- **Metadata Override**: If Audible API doesn't find your book, you can manually enter all metadata
- **Large Files**: Be patient with large audiobooks - conversion can take several minutes
- **Network**: Ensure you have a stable connection to your Audiobookshelf server for uploads

## Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg failed" error
- Ensure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are installed: `sudo dnf install ffmpeg`

### "Upload failed" error
- Verify your ABS server URL is correct (include `https://`)
- Check that your API token hasn't expired
- Ensure the library ID is correct

### No metadata found
- The Audible API might not have your book - use manual entry
- Check your internet connection

### MP3 files not detected
- Ensure files have `.mp3` extension (case-insensitive)
- Check that you're dragging a folder, not individual files

## Development

### Project Architecture

- **UI Layer** (`main.rs`): Qt/QML interface with qmetaobject Rust bindings
- **Service Layer** (`services.rs`): All business logic for audio processing and API calls
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for non-blocking I/O operations
- **Communication**: Qt signals/slots and queued callbacks for UI thread safety

### Key Technologies

- **Qt/QML**: Cross-platform GUI framework with qmetaobject bindings
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent operations
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for API calls
- **FFmpeg**: External process for audio conversion and metadata embedding
- **serde**: JSON serialization/deserialization
